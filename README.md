# Dataref Tool for X-Plane plugin development

DRT is an X-plane plugin intended to replacement for Sandy Barbour's Dataref Editor (DRE). While the core functionality will be very much the same (viewing and editing datarefs), I intend to add the following additional features:

* Case insensitive search
* Regex search
* Only show datarefs that have changed recently

###License
DRT is available under the MIT license. See the LICENSE file for more details.
